# CPU-SIM

A small CPU simulation project built out of curiosity about how CPUs actually work, and as a way to learn Java by going closer to the metal.

## Description

CPU-SIM is a minimal CPU simulator with:

- 4 general-purpose registers  
- 100 memory locations  

The goal is not performance or realism, but understanding: how instructions are executed, how state changes over time, and why CPUs are structured the way they are.

## Current Features

- Basic instruction execution  
- Fixed-size register set  
- Simple memory model  

## Future Plans

- Add more instructions  
- Add a step-by-step execution mode (for debugging and learning)  
- Improve the UI  
  - Possibly visualize memory locations and register states
